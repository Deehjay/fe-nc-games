The House of Games serves as the frontend component for the full stack application I've made during my time with the award-winning bootcamp, Northcoders. The frontend works in tandem with the RESTful API created during the back-end review week (link above). This application has a multitude of features, such as allowing visitors to view board game reviews; to read individual reviews and comments; to post and delete their own reviews providing they are logged in, and more.

Reviews can be sorted using the collapsible component below the website's header.

## Running the website locally

### Cloning the repo

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you'd like to clone the repo to. Paste the following command into the terminal:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Deehjay/be-nc-games.git
```

### Installing dependencies

Once the repo has been successfully cloned, install all dependencies using:

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Starting the local server

Once all dependencies have been installed, the server can be started using:

```shell
$ npm start
```

The locally hosted website should open automatically. If it doesn't, a link to the server will also be displayed in the terminal.
